alt: alt="Picture of Box Jellyfish"
names: <em>Cubozoa</em>, sea wasp, marine stinger
features: They are pale blue and transparent in color and get their name from the cube-like shape of their bell. Up to 15 tentacles grow from each corner of the bell and can reach 10 feet (3 meters) in length. Each tentacle has about 5,000 stinging cells, which are triggered not by touch but by the presence of a chemical on the outer layer of its prey.
size: 10 ft (3 m) long; 10 in (25 cm) in diameter.
distribution: They live primarily in coastal waters off Northern Australia and throughout the Indo-Pacific.
toxicity: Deadly
other: <li>Box Jellyfish's venom is considered to be among the <strong>most deadly in the world</strong>, containing toxins that attack the heart, nervous system, and skin cells. It is so overpoweringly painful, human victims have been known to go into shock and drown or die of heart failure before even reaching shore. Survivors can experience considerable pain for weeks and often have significant scarring where the tentacles made contact.</li><li>Box jellies are highly advanced among jellyfish. <strong>They can move</strong> (instead of just drift); they can jet at up to four knots through the water.</li><li><strong>They have eyes too!</strong> They are grouped in clusters of six on the four sides of their bell. Each cluster includes a pair of eyes with a sophisticated lens, retina, iris and cornea, although without a central nervous system, scientists arenâ€™t sure how they process what they see.</li>
