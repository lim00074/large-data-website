	<h2>Anatomy</h2>

	<p>Most jellyfish do <em>not</em> have specialized digestive, osmoregulatory (what keeps an organism's fluids from being too diluted or concentrated), central nervous (like the brain), respiratory (lungs), or circulatory systems (blood). The manubrium is a stalk-like structure hanging down from the centre of the underside, with the mouth at its tip. This opens into the gastrovascular cavity, where digestion takes place and nutrients are absorbed. It is joined to the radial canals which extend to the margin of the bell. Jellyfish do not need a respiratory system since their skin is thin enough that the body is oxygenated by diffusion. They have limited control over movement, but can use their hydrostatic skeleton to navigate through contraction-pulsations of the bell-like body; some species actively swim most of the time, while others are mostly passive. Depending on the species, the body contains between <em>95 and 98% water</em>. Most of the umbrella mass is a gelatinous material — the jelly — called <em>mesoglea</em> which is surrounded by two layers of protective skin. The top layer is called the <em>epidermis</em>, and the inner layer is referred to as <em>gastrodermis</em>, which lines the gut.</p>

		<h3>Nervous System</h3>
		<p>Jellyfish employ a loose network of nerves, located in the epidermis, which is called a <em>nerve net</em>. Although traditionally thought not to have a central nervous system, nerve net concentration and ganglion-like structures could be considered to constitute one in most species. A jellyfish detects various stimuli including the touch of other animals via this nerve net, which then transmits impulses both throughout the nerve net and around a circular nerve ring, through the rhopalial lappet, located at the rim of the jellyfish body, to other nerve cells.</p>
		<p>Another counter to the <em>brainless jellyfish</em> hypothesis is that some species explicitly adapt to tidal flux to control their location. In Roscoe Bay, jellyfish ride the current at ebb tide until they hit a gravel bar, and then descend below the current. They remain in still waters waiting for the tide to rise, ascending and allowing it to sweep them back into the bay. They monitor salinity to avoid fresh water from mountain snowmelt, again by diving until they find enough salt.</p>
		<h3>Vision</h3>
		<p>Some jellyfish have <em>ocelli</em>: light-sensitive organs that do not form images but which can detect light and are used to determine up from down, responding to sunlight shining on the water's surface. These are generally pigment spot ocelli, which have some cells (not all) pigmented.</p>
		<p>Certain species of jellyfish, such as the box jellyfish, have been revealed to be more advanced than their counterparts. The <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/species.html#box">box jellyfish</a> has <em>24 eyes</em>, two of which are capable of seeing color, and four parallel information processing areas or rhopalia that act in competition, supposedly making it one of the few creatures to have a 360-degree view of its environment.</p>
		<p>The eyes are suspended on stalks with heavy crystals on one end, acting like a gyroscope to orient the eyes skyward. They look upward to navigate from roots in mangrove swamps to the open lagoon and back, watching for the mangrove canopy, where they feed.</p>
		<h3>Size</h3>
		<p>Jellyfish range from about one millimeter in bell height and diameter to nearly two meters in bell height and diameter; the tentacles and mouth parts usually extend beyond this bell dimension.</p>

		<p>The <strong>smallest jellyfish</strong> are the peculiar creeping jellyfish in the genera Staurocladia and Eleutheria, which have bell disks from 0.5 mm to a few mm diameter, with short tentacles that extend out beyond this, on which these tiny jellyfish crawl around on seaweed or the bottoms of rocky pools. Many of these tiny creeping jellyfish cannot be seen in the field without a hand lens or microscope; they can reproduce asexually by splitting in half (called fission). Other very small jellyfish, which have bells about one mm, are the hydromedusae of many species that have just been released from their parent polyps; some of these live only a few minutes before shedding their gametes in the plankton and then dying, while others will grow in the plankton for weeks or months. The hydromedusae Cladonema radiatum and Cladonema californicum (see image) are also very small, living for months, yet never growing beyond a few mm in bell height and diameter. Another small species of jellyfish is the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/species.html#irukandji">Australian Irukandji</a>, which is about the size of a fingernail.</p>
		<p>The <strong>largest jellyfish</strong> is the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/species.html#lions-mane">lion's mane jellyfish</a>, Cyanea capillata, and arguably <strong>the longest animal in the world</strong>, with fine, thread-like tentacles that may extend up to 36.5 metres (120 ft) long (though most are nowhere near that large). They have a moderately painful, but rarely fatal, sting. Claims that this jellyfish may be the longest animal in the world are likely exaggerated; some other planktonic cnidarians called siphonophores may typically be tens of meters long and seem a more legitimate candidate for longest animal.</p>
		<h3>Movement</h3>
		<p>Jellyfish move through the water by radially expanding and contracting their bell-shaped bodies to push water behind them. They pause between the contraction and expansion to create a vortex that pushes them forward. The displaced water creates a <em>hole</em> that when re-filled, propels them forward. The vortex allows the animal to travel 30% farther on each stroke. This reduces the energy required. Jellyfish achieved a 48 percent lower cost of transport (the amount of food and oxygen consumed, versus energy spent in movement) than other animals in similar studies.</p>
