# Style Report

## Version 1

### Pros
* Looks fun and interesting
* Thematic: imitates viewing jellyfish in a dark aquarium under special lights

### Cons
* White text on a black background, as well as the bright colours Will tire the eyes out quickly
* Only appeals to younger viewers
* Lighter images will not match with the overall funky look

---
## Version 2

### Pros
* Calming, naturalistic
* Thematic: Imitates underwater sea
* Because the background imitates the natural setting, it will compliment almost any type of image
* Interesting enough that people of any age might find it appealing

### Cons
* Diagrams and above-water images might look out of place

---
## Version 3

### Pros
* Professional
* Neutral, so it can handle any type of image

### Cons
* Younger viewers might find it boring
* Unoriginal, in that it looks like a typical large-format website

After assessing the pros and cons, I would likely go for the second version,it is the most stylistically interesting and compatible for numerous audiences.
