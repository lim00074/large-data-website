## Observations

- No questions that stood out unless there was unfamiliar terminology
- Did they struggle with certain articles or topics?
 - Common groupings: used Jellyfish as a category, and also grouped kinds/types of jellyfish
- Overall, groupings matched my expectations
- Personal thoughts while watching them organize: I will have to go back and reconsider my categories
