	<h2>Cool Jellyfish</h2>
	<p>Jellyfish are truly mysterious and diverse creatures. In fact, it is estimated that there are approximately 1000 to 1500 species that we know of worldwide!</p>
	<p>Below is information on 4 of the more popular or interesting jellyfish, in my opinion.</p>

		<h4>Names:</h4>
		<p><em>Cyanea capillata</em>, hair jelly</p>
		<h4>Key Features:</h4>
		<p>Large flat bell, red or dark brown in colour. Small individuals can have a yellowish colour. Masses of many long tentacles.</p>
		<h4>Size:</h4>
		<p>Up to 1m in diameter, but usually much smaller.</p>

		<h4>Toxicity:</h4>
		<p>Severe sting</p>
		<h4>Other Interesting Information:</h4>
		<p><strong>Largest</strong> known species of jellyfish.</p>
		<p>The largest recorded specimen found had washed up on the shore of Massachusetts Bay in 1870, and had a bell (body) with a diameter of 7 feet 6 inches (2.29 m) and tentacles 120 feet (37 m) long.</p>

		<h3>Box Jellyfish</h3>
		<img src="http://placehold.it/300x200" class="img-species">
		<h4>Names:</h4>
		<p><em>Cubozoa</em>, sea wasp, marine stinger</p>
		<h4>Key Features:</h4>
		<p>They are pale blue and transparent in color and get their name from the cube-like shape of their bell. Up to 15 tentacles grow from each corner of the bell and can reach 10 feet (3 meters) in length. Each tentacle has about 5,000 stinging cells, which are triggered not by touch but by the presence of a chemical on the outer layer of its prey.</p>
		<h4>Size:</h4>
		<p>10 ft (3 m) long; 10 in (25 cm) in diameter</p>
		<h4>Distribution:</h4>
		<p>They live primarily in coastal waters off Northern Australia and throughout the Indo-Pacific.</p>
		<h4>Toxicity:</h4>
		<p>Deadly</p>
		<h4>Other Interesting Information:</h4>
		<p>Box Jellyfish's venom is considered to be among the <strong>most deadly in the world</strong>, containing toxins that attack the heart, nervous system, and skin cells. It is so overpoweringly painful, human victims have been known to go into shock and drown or die of heart failure before even reaching shore. Survivors can experience considerable pain for weeks and often have significant scarring where the tentacles made contact.</p>
		<p>Box jellies are highly advanced among jellyfish. <strong>They can move</strong> (instead of just drift): they can jet at up to four knots through the water.</p>
		<p><strong>They have eyes too!</strong> They are grouped in clusters of six on the four sides of their bell. Each cluster includes a pair of eyes with a sophisticated lens, retina, iris and cornea, although without a central nervous system, scientists aren’t sure how they process what they see.</p>

		<h3>Irukandji Jellyfish</h3>
		<img src="http://placehold.it/300x200" class="img-species">
		<h4>Names:</h4>
		<p><em>Carukia barnesi</em></p>
		<h4>Key Features:</h4>
		<p>Irukandji jellyfish are very small with four long tentacles, which range in length from just a few centimeters up to 1 metre (3.3 ft) in length. The stingers (nematocysts) are in clumps, appearing as rings of small red dots around the bell and along the tentacles.</p>
		<h4>Size:</h4>
		<p>A few centimeters to 1 metre long; 5 to 25 millimeters in diameter</p>
		<h4>Distribution:</h4>
		<p>Irukandji jellyfish were at one time thought to be in the northern waters of Australia only. Since then, the species has been found in waters as far north as the British Isles, Japan, and the Florida coast of the United States.</p>
		<h4>Toxicity:</h4>
		<p>Deadly</p>
		<h4>Other Interesting Information:</h4>
		<p><strong>Smallest</strong> known species of jellyfish.</p>
		<p>Irukandji has stingers not only on its tentacles but also on its bell. Although its venom does not kill as quickly as the box jellyfish, the Irukandji jellyfish is known as the <strong>most toxic jellyfish</strong> in the world.</p>
