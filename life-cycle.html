	<h2>Life Cycle & Ecology</h2>

	<p>Did you know that Jellyfish in the wild only live from a few hours up to just a few months? Within this period of time, they basically eat and reproduce.</p>

		<h3>Life Cycle</h3>
		<img class="margin-bottom" src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/jellyfish-life-cycle.jpg" alt="Illustration of the Jellyfish Life Cycle">

		<h4>Life Span</h4>
		<p>Jellyfish lifespans typically range from a few hours (in the case of some very small hydromedusae) to several months. Life generally ends after the <a href="#phases">medusa</a> has begun <a href="#spawning">spawning</a>. Life span varies by species. Most large coastal jellyfish live 2 to 6 months, during which they grow from a millimeter or two to many centimeters in diameter.</p>
		<p>Aquarium jellyfish that are carefully tended, fed daily even when food might be seasonally rare in the wild, and sometimes treated with antibiotics if they develop infections, may live several years, though this would be very unusual in the wild.</p>
		<p>One unusual species is reported to live as long as <em>30 years</em>! Another unusual species, <em>T. nutricula</em>, might be effectively immortal because of its ability under certain circumstances to transform from medusa back to the polyp stage, thereby escaping the death that typically awaits medusae post-reproduction if they have not otherwise been eaten by some other ocean organism. So far this reversal has been observed only in the laboratory.</p>

		<h4 id="phases">Phases</h4>
		<p>Jellyfish development occurs in multiple phases (though in some species, speciments may skip some phases):</p>
		<ol>
			<li class="li-padding-bottom"><strong>Eggs and sperm develop into larval planulae.</strong> The <em>planula</em> is a small larva covered with cilia. It settles onto a firm surface and develops into a polyp.</li>
			<li class="li-padding-bottom"><strong>Become polyps.</strong> The <em>polyp</em> is generally a small stalk with a mouth that is ringed by upward-facing tentacles. The polyps resemble the closely related Cnidaria anthozoan (sea anemones and corals) polyps. The jellyfish polyp may be sessile, living on the bottom or on another substrate such as floats or boat hulls, or it may be free-floating or attached to tiny bits of free-living plankton or rarely, fish or other invertebrates. Polyps may be solitary or colonial. Polyp colonies form by strobilation, in which multiple polyps share a common stomach cavity. Most polyps are only millimeters in size. They feed continuously. The polyp stage may last for years.</li>
			<li class="li-padding-bottom"><strong>Bud into ephyrae.</strong> The <em>ephyra</em> is a free-swimming precursor of the final adult stage.</li>
			<li class="li-padding-bottom"><strong>Transform into adult medusae.</strong> The <em>medusa</em> is the life stage that is typically identified as a jellyfish.</li>
		</ol>

		<h4 id="spawning">Spawning and Reproduction</h4>
		<p>Upon reaching adult size, jellyfish spawn daily given enough food. In most species, spawning is controlled by light, so the entire population spawns at about the same time of day, often at either dusk or dawn. Jellyfish are usually either male or female (with occasional hermaphrodites—which are organisms with both male and female reproductive organs). In most cases, adults release sperm and eggs into the surrounding water, where the (unprotected) eggs are fertilized and mature into new organisms.</p>

		<h3>Ecology</h3>

		<h4>Diet</h4>
		<p>Jellies are carnivorous, feeding on plankton, crustaceans, fish eggs, small fish and other jellyfish, ingesting and voiding through the same hole in the middle of the bell. Jellies hunt passively using their tentacles as drift nets.</p>

			<h4>Predation</h4>
			<img class="img-margin-bottom img-float-width" src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/ecology-turtle-eating-jellyfish.jpg" alt="Picture of a Turtle Eating a Jellyfish">
			<p>Other species of jellyfish are among the most common and important jellyfish predators, some of which specialize in jellies. Other predators include tuna, shark, swordfish, sea turtles, and at least one species of Pacific salmon. Sea birds sometimes pick symbiotic crustaceans from the jellyfish bells near the sea's surface, inevitably feeding also on the jellyfish hosts of these amphipods or young crabs and shrimp.</p>

			<h4>Blooms</h4>
			<img class="img-margin-bottom img-float-width" src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/ecology-jellyfish-bloom.jpg" alt="Picture Jellyfish Bloom">
			<p>Jellyfish bloom formation is a complex process that depends on ocean currents, nutrients, sunshine, temperature, season, prey availability, reduced predation and oxygen concentrations. Ocean currents tend to congregate jellyfish into large swarms or <em>blooms</em>, consisting of hundreds or thousands of individuals. Blooms can also result from unusually high populations in some years. Jellyfish are better able to survive in nutrient-rich, oxygen-poor water than competitors, and thus can feast on plankton without competition. Jellyfish may also benefit from saltier waters, as saltier waters contain more iodine, which is necessary for polyps to turn into jellyfish. Rising sea temperatures caused by climate change may also contribute to jellyfish blooms, because many species of jellyfish are relatively better able to survive in warmer waters.</p>

		<div class="clearfix">
			<h4>Population</h4>
			<p>Jellyfish populations may be expanding globally as a result of overfishing of their natural predators and the availability of excessive nutrients due to land runoff. When marine ecosystems become disturbed jellyfish can proliferate. For example, jellyfish reproduce rapidly and have fast growth rates; they predate many species, while few species predate them; and they feed via touch rather than visually, so they can feed effectively at night and in turbid waters. It may become difficult for fish stocks to reestablish themselves in marine ecosystems once they have become dominated by jellyfish, because jellyfish feed on plankton, which includes fish eggs and larvae.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="clearfix margin-bottom">
			<h4>Habitat</h4>
			<p>Although most jellyfish are marine animals, some inhabit freshwater. This is most common for hydromedusae (in fact many hydrozoa inhabit freshwater). The best known example is the cosmopolitan freshwater jellyfish, Craspedacusta sowerbii. It is less than an inch (2.5 cm) in diameter, colorless and does not sting.</p>
			<img class="img-margin-bottom img-float-width" src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/jellyfish-cassiopea-andromeda-mangrovenqualle.jpg" alt="Picture of Cassiopea Andromeda—an Upside-Down Jellyfish">
			<p>A few species of jellyfish are also closely associated with the bottom of the ocean for much of their lives (that is, they can be considered benthic). The upside-down jellyfish in the genus Cassiopea typically lie on the bottom of shallow lagoons where they sometimes pulsate gently with their umbrella top facing down. The tiny creeping jellyfish Staurocladia and Eleutheria (see section on Size, above) cannot swim and "walk" around on seaweed fronds or rocky bottoms on their tentacles. Most hydromedusae and scyphomedusae that live in coastal habitats find themselves on the bottom periodically, where they may stop swimming for a while, and certain box jellyfish species also rest on the sea bed in shallow water. Even some deep-sea species of hydromedusae and scyphomedusae are usually collected on or near the bottom. All of the stauromedusae are found attached to either seaweed or rocky or other firm material on the bottom.</p>

			<img class="img-margin-bottom img-float-width" src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/jellyfish-lake.jpg" alt="A Picture of Jellyfish Lake">
			<p>Some other jellyfish populations have also become restricted into lakes, such as <strong>Jellyfish Lake in Palau</strong>, which is populated by Golden Jellyfish (as seen in the photo) and <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/species.html#moon">Moon Jellyfish</a> (though the jellyfish do have stingers, they are too small to be felt by humans). The isolated lakes became the perfect setting for a jellyfish explosion, which some speculate were trapped in the lake 12,000 years ago after a rise in sea levels post-Ice Age. Feeding on quick-growing algae and with no predators to keep them in check, the jellyfish now completely pack the small lake. During the day, the jellyfish migrate from one side of the lake to the other to follow the path of the sun, which feeds the algae they survive on.</p>
