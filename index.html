		<h2>Introduction to Jellyfish</h2>
		<div class="grid">
			<div class="unit unit-s-1 unit-m-1 unit-l-1">
				<p><strong>Jellyfish</strong>, or <strong>jellies</strong>, are one of nature's unusual and mysterious creatures. Though jellyfish are commonly known and easily recognized, the average person knows little to nothing about them: how they work, what they're made of, and that they <em>sting</em>! We'll be exploring these issues and more, as we venture into the world of jellyfish!</p>

				<h3>What Are Jellyfish?</h3> <!--the section below has been taken from: http://science.howstuffworks.com/zoology/marine-life/jellyfish.htm-->
				<p>Jellyfish live mainly in the ocean, but they aren't actually fish—they're plankton. These plants and animals either float in the water or possess such limited swimming powers that currents control their horizontal movements. Some plankton are microscopic, single-celled organisms, while others are several feet long. Jellyfish can range in size from less than an inch to nearly 7 feet long, with tentacles up to 100 feet long.</p>

				<p>Jellyfish are about 98 percent water. If a jellyfish washes up on the beach, it will mostly disappear as the water evaporates. Most are transparent and bell-shaped. Their bodies have radial symmetry, which means that the body parts extend from a central point like the spokes on a wheel. If you cut a jellyfish in half at any point, you'll always get equal halves. Jellyfish have very simple bodies—hey don't have bones, a brain or a heart. To see light, detect smells and orient themselves, they have rudimentary sensory nerves at the base of their tentacles.</p>

				<h4>Anatomy</h4>
				<p>A jellyfish's body generally comprises six basic parts:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>The epidermis, which protects the inner organs</li>
					<li>The gastrodermis, which is the inner layer</li>
					<li>The mesoglea, or middle jelly, between the epidermis and gastrodermis</li>
					<li>The gastrovascular cavity, which functions as a gullet, stomach, and intestine all in one</li>
					<li>An orifice that functions as both the mouth and anus</li>
					<li>Tentacles that line the edge of the body</li>
				</ul>
