		<h2>Jellyfish Toxicity</h2>
		<img class="margin-bottom img-float-width" src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/jellyfish-toxicity.png" alt="Picture of a Jellyfish Warning Sign">
		<p>Jellyfish stings are relatively common problems for people swimming, wading or diving in seawaters. The long tentacles trailing from the jellyfish body can discharge thousands of microscopic barbed stingers that release venom into your skin.</p>
		<p>Jellyfish stings can vary greatly in severity. Most often they result in immediate pain and red, irritated marks on the skin. Some jellyfish stings may cause more whole-body (systemic) illness, and in rare cases, jellyfish stings are life-threatening.</p>
		<p>Most jellyfish stings get better with <a href="#treatments">home treatment</a>, but <em>severe reactions</em> require <a href="#medical-treatments">emergency medical care</a>. Seek emergency treatment if the stings cover large areas of the skin, a severe reaction, and/or if it affects your any of your body systems (systemic reactions), which may appear rapidly or several hours after a sting. (See <a href="#severe-symptoms">Severe signs and symptoms</a>)</p>

			<h3>Jellyfish Sting Symptoms</h3>
			<img class="margin-bottom img-float-width" src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/jellyfish-sting.jpg" alt="Picture of a Jellyfish Sting">
			<p>The severity of reactions to jellyfish stings depend on a number of factors, including the species and size of the jellyfish, the age and size of the person, the duration of exposure, and the area of skin affected.</p>
			<p>Although jellyfish stings can be quite painful, most are minor and get better with home treatment. If left untreated the symptoms generally resolve within one to two weeks. Discoloration of the skin may last one to two months.</p>

		<h3>Sting Treatments</h3>
		<h4>Home remedies</h4>
		<p>Most jellyfish stings can be treated with relatively simple home remedies:</p>
		<ol>
			<li class="li-padding-bottom"><strong>Remove tentacles.</strong> When you come into contact with a jellyfish tentacle, it may detach from the jellyfish and stick to your skin. Remove any remaining pieces of tentacle by washing the area with seawater. Avoid using fresh water, because it may activate the venomous stingers (nematocysts) that are embedded in your skin but have not yet released venom. Also avoid touching the tentacles with your hands. If necessary, use an object like a credit card to gently brush it off. Rubbing it off with a towel or clothing is likely to cause the discharge of more venom.</li>
			<li class="li-padding-bottom"><strong>Deactivate stingers.</strong> Generously rinsing the affected area with vinegar for at least 30 seconds may deactivate the nematocysts of some species — essentially shutting down the nematocysts embedded in the skin that have not yet discharged venom. A deactivating treatment recommended for sea nettles or Portuguese man-of-wars is a paste made of baking soda and seawater.</li>
			<li class="li-padding-bottom"><strong>Relieve pain or irritation.</strong> There has been some disagreement over whether cold or heat is better for relieving pain. However, recent studies have suggested that soaking the affected area in tolerably hot fresh water for at least 20 minutes — after the vinegar or baking soda treatment — may be more effective in pain relief, because the heat may decrease the potency of the venom. The temperature should be between 104° and 113° F (40° and 45° C). Lotions or ointments, such as calamine lotion or lidocaine, may relieve itching or discomfort.</li>
		</ol>

		<h4>Home remedies to avoid</h4>
		<p>A number of at-home treatments have been proposed, but they’re generally not recommended, either because there's no research backing up their use or research indicates they aren't effective. These remedies include: human urine, meat tenderizer, ethanol, pressure bandages</p>

		<a id="medical-treatments"></a>
		<h4>Medical treatments for severe stings</h4>
		<p>People who have stings covering a large area or who have experienced severe or systemic reactions are usually observed for at least six to eight hours because of possible delayed reactions.</p>
		<p>People experiencing severe or systemic reactions need immediate emergency care that may include:</p>
		<ul class="ul-padding li-bullets">
			<li><strong>Resuscitation.</strong> If a jellyfish sting results in sudden loss of heart function (cardiac arrest), immediate cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is necessary. An injection of epinephrine may be required for anaphylaxis.</li>
			<li><strong>Life support.</strong> If you have a serious reaction that affects multiple body functions, the first priority in emergency treatment is to stabilize your breathing, heart rate, blood pressure and other vital functions.</li>
			<li><strong>Antivenin.</strong> If the sting is from a box jellyfish, you may need an immediate dose of a drug designed to neutralize the venom (antivenin).</li>
			<li><strong>Pain control.</strong> If a jellyfish sting causes severe pain, an injection of pain medication may be necessary.</li>
		</ul>

		<h4>Other medical treatments</h4>
		<p>Other circumstances may require doctor-supervised treatment:</p>
		<ul class="ul-padding li-bullets">
			<li><strong>Hypersensitivity.</strong> A rash or other skin reaction due to delayed hypersensitivity may be treated with oral antihistamines or corticosteroid ointments or creams.</li>
			<li><strong>Affected eyes.</strong> A jellyfish sting occurring on or near an eye requires immediate medical care for appropriate flushing of the eye. A doctor specializing in eye care (ophthalmologist) will likely examine the eye and may prescribe corticosteroid ointments or drops to treat pain and inflammation.</li>
		</ul>
