# Jellyfish

I recently visited Singapore and saw the world's largest aquarium. The jellyfish (or jellies) were so beautiful and fascinating to watch. A week later, my sister and I found a jelly on the beach, and we were both stung by one. This personal encounter made me realize it would be useful to learn more about them; I would like to learn more about the anatomy of the jellyfish—as its so different from other creatures—as well as its toxin and how to treat it.


## Purpose
